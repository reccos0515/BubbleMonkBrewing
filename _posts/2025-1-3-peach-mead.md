 8. Seal using a sanitizer filled airlock and set in a cool dark place
 9. After fermentation Stabilize, Backsweeten and add the vanilla extract

## Backsweetening
So I tried something odd to backsweeten this because I wanted to up the peach flavor as much as possible So I'm preserving that process here. 
 1. Boil the peach Jumex to reduce its volume like a syrup, stir constantly and only boil as long as you're comfortable with.
 2. Combine 1/4 cup peach syrup and 1/2 cup honey in a measuring cup and strir to combine.
 3. Add to the Stabilized mead and stir to combine.
 4. Taste, Evalute, repeat steps 2 and 3 if needed.
