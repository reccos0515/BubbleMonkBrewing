#### A collection of what I use, both physical and software. Also a couple processes
****

### Stabilizing for 1 gallon
 1. Use 1 crushed [Campden Tablet](https://www.amazon.com/Campden-Tablets-sodium-metabisulfite-100/dp/B0064H0KC6) and gently stir, wait 24 hrs
 2. Add 1/2 tsp [Potassium Sorbate](https://www.amazon.com/North-Mountain-Supply-Potassium-Stabilizer/dp/B0BGQLW5NP) stir gently, wait 24 hours
 3. Your Mead is now stabilized

### Backsweetening
 - Backsweetening will basically always be a matter of personal taste, use a turkey baster and a shot glass to take samples while sweetening. I personally go at 1/2 cup of honey per addition when using a gallon sized fermenter.

1. Add 1/2 cup honey to pyrex measuring cup
2. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup boiling water to the measuring cup
3. Gently stir until they're combined
4. Add the mixture to the fermenting vessel and stir to combine
5. Taste, asses and repeat if necessary

### Software Resources
 - Tosna Calculator - [Link](https://www.meadmaderight.com/tosna-calculator) - Used for calculating how much yeast nutrient to add and when to add
 - [ABV Calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/abv-calculator/) - Used for calculating the ABV after **INITIAL FERMENTATION ONLY**
     - Initial ABV is your original gravity measurment minus your final gravity measurement multiplied by 131.25, but i'm lazy so i use the above linked site.

#### For Calculating the ABV after back sweetening use this formula

### Yeast
 - Yeast can spoil, purchase in a 5 pack at most imo, or find a local supply.

### Actual Physical Equipment I have
 - Fermenting Vessel 1.32 Gallon - [Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BSNRBWQH)
 - Fermaid O Yeast Nutrient - [Link](https://www.amazon.com/North-Mountain-Supply-Fermaid-Nutrient/dp/B0CFYQC5JG)
 - Hydrometer - [Link](https://www.amazon.com/North-Mountain-Supply-NMSTS-H-Hydrometer/dp/B07DMJRYNK)
 - Graduated Cylinder - [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Measuring-Cylinder-100ml-Polypropylene-Autoclavable/dp/B00AITZUMQ)
 - Bottles + Corks - [Link](https://www.amazon.com/North-Mountain-Supply-Bordeaux-Flat-Bottomed/dp/B07N4QFT1F)
 - Star San - [Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064O7YFA)
 - Go Ferm - [Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFYNZTQB)
 - Kitchen scale - [Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09R8ZKDGP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) is a life saver, but for nutrient additions you'll need one that's more precise (down to tenth of a gram I think, ex [this](https://www.amazon.com/Weigh-Gram-Digital-Jewelry-Kitchen/dp/B06Y61YW7S)

Use Spring water for brews not tap, better minerals/no bacteria
