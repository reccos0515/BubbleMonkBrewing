**2/11/25** - Started batch, 1.092 SG about ~1.2 gallons. Really boring mead to be making tbh just a traditional honey water and yeast, should make a good base for the spices tho.

**2/18/25** - Added the measured yeast nutrient over the first 4 days, now a week later the fermentation is still going strong, probably needs another 3-4 days.
