**2/11/25** - Started batch, 1.092 SG about ~1.2 gallons. Really boring mead to be making tbh just a traditional honey water and yeast, should make a good base for the spices tho.

**2/18/25** - Added the measured yeast nutrient over the first 4 days, now a week later the fermentation is still going strong, probably needs another 3-4 days.

**2/23/25** - This mead just will not stop slowly fermenting, going to take a gravity reading today to see where it's currently at but it's essentially been slowly fermenting for this entire time. This means I feel like I shouldn't stabalize and start secondary.

Gravity is at 1.024, ~9% ABV. So I guess since it's still bubbling I'll just leave it, I'll keep degassing and hope it goes dry. The taste and smell is still harsh and yeast-y so I'm going to take that as a sign that the yeast is alive and well and still fermenting.
