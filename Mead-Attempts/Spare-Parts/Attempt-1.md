**1/21/25** - Starting brew today, after i'm done spicing the peach mead.

Ended up being 2 lbs flat of frozen fruit and 2.5 lbs of honey. Starting gravity 1.090, so this has the potential to hit 11.8%

**1/22/25** - Checked in, fermentation has started but less active than previous brews, I followed tosna's guidance for how much yeast to add (1/2 a packet) so it makes sense it might be a bit slower to start. Degassed for the first time, going to add nutrient later today.

Added nutrient, seems like even though I left more headspace this time around there's now less overall. Unsure if that will continue to change.
