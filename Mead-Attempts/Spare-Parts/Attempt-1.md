**1/21/25** - Starting brew today, after i'm done spicing the peach mead.

Ended up being 2 lbs flat of frozen fruit and 2.5 lbs of honey. Starting gravity 1.090, so this has the potential to hit 11.8%

**1/22/25** - Checked in, fermentation has started but less active than previous brews, I followed tosna's guidance for how much yeast to add (1/2 a packet) so it makes sense it might be a bit slower to start. Degassed for the first time, going to add nutrient later today.

Added nutrient, seems like even though I left more headspace this time around there's now less overall. Unsure if that will continue to change.

**1/24/25** - Added nutrient/degassed every day so far, after I add nutrient I need to sit and wait to make sure the foam goes away so that's cool. Counting from the start date this was the last nutirent addition and in ~3 or 4 days I should expect to stabilize and spice the mead.

**1/26/25** - I've been degassing the mead and fermentation is still pretty active, it hasn't cleared at all which i'm a little worried about but it might be because of the degassing.

**1/28/25** - Still fermenting but definitely has slowed down, I'm thinking I should stop degassing to try and allow it to clear.

**2/1/25** - Racked the mead and added Campden Tablets, Final Gravity ended up being 0.996 which will be 12.34%

Also as a note, peaches suck for making a clear mead like holy crap. The normal peach mead didn't clear and this isn't clearing either, which means the color and opacity are weird, drinking wise I don't care but still for the future I'm going to stay away from peaches.

**2/2/25** - Added Potasium Sorbate, will backsweeten tomorrow.

**2/3/25** - Added 1.25 cups of honey/water, crazy low amount compared to what I normally need to add so i'm never doubting Tosna again. Added the spices, I'm hyped as fuck. Since I used less sweetener and the attenuation was 105% this mead has ended up at ~11.4% ABV

**2/7/25** - 5 and 1/2 bottles, and the 1/2 is deffinitely 10% sediment. From tasting the spices are pronounced but not overbearing I think I can push it further or add more spices up front, I should exclude allspice next time and include the whole nutmeg.
